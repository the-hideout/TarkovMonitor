TarkovMonitor reads Escape From Tarkov log files in real-time to deliver audio alerts, raid timers, quest automation via TarkovTracker, and map integration with Tarkov.dev.

This documentation is for advanced users and contributors who want to configure, debug, or extend the application.

## Setup and Configuration

### TarkovTracker Integration
1. Log in to https://tarkovtracker.org
2. Create an API's token, depending on your game mod (PvP / PvE)
4. Name the token as desired
5. Copy the token and paste into TarkovMonitor settings in the API Token field
6. Click Test Token to confirm proper setup

TarkovMonitor must be running for quest progress to be detected.  
To sync past completions, use the Read Past Logs option in Settings.

### Tarkov.dev Remote Integration
1. Open https://tarkov.dev in the browser you want to control
2. Click "Click to connect" in the lower-left corner
3. Copy the displayed Remote ID
4. Paste it in the Remote ID setting inside TarkovMonitor
5. Keep the browser window open while playing

If the browser restarts or is refreshed, repeat the connect process.

## How It Works
Escape From Tarkov logs contain events such as matchmaking progress and quest completion. TarkovMonitor observes new log lines as they are written.

Logs do not update in active raids, so no in-raid interaction or automation is possible.

Optional data sent externally:
- Map played
- Time spent queueing
- PMC or Scav info

This information is sent anonymously and only if queue submission is enabled.

## Technical FAQ

Q: Does TarkovMonitor modify the game or memory?  
A: No. It only reads log files generated by the game.

Q: Why does nothing update while I am in-raid?  
A: EFT does not update logs during raids.

Q: Why are completed quests missing?  
A: They must occur while TarkovMonitor is running. Use Read Past Logs to backfill progress.

Q: Can it track PMC level or hideout upgrades?  
A: No. Those are not recorded in logs.

## Troubleshooting

Issue: WebView2 error at launch  
Solution: Install the Microsoft WebView2 Runtime  
See: GitHub Issue #22

Issue: Quest syncing does not work  
Solution: Verify token and allowed permissions

Issue: Map does not change automatically on Tarkov.dev  
Solution: Reconnect remote after browser reload
